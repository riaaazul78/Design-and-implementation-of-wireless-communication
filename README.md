# Design-and-implementation-of-wireless-communication
This project focuses on the design and development of a wireless communication system enabling data transmission between devices without physical connections. It explores key concepts such as signal encoding, modulation, and transmission using wireless modules (e.g., RF, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi). The system is implemented to ensure reliable, low-latency, and energy-efficient communication. This repository includes hardware schematics, code implementation, and performance analysis for optimizing range, data rate, and error minimization.
